When it comes to collaborative work, we thought it might be a really good idea to provide some clear instructions on how we'd like muffin's branding to appear across the web.

Although there aren't many things to consider, they really help us a lot to maintain a consistent image and feel across various mediums.  

## Naming

1. Except on the beginning of a sentence, please don't use capital letters when refering to muffin.

2. Plugins should be named like this: "muffin-plugin-name". Please make sure to keep plugin-name as short as possible (this will make refering to your plugin in articles and in speech much easier).

## Logo

If you'd like to include muffin's logo in a certain project if yours, you can download the asset file [here](https://github.com/muffin/branding).

Currently, there are no special guidelines for how the logo should be displayed. So feel free to do whatever you want with it!
